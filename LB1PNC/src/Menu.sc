You may feel that there is a lack of a "quest." Well, in a way, you're right. There isn't a "quest," as such. Your goal is to get to know the story and the characters; to understand what's going on; and to survive the long night. We feel that "The Colonel's Bequest" is a true interactive STORY rather than a game and every effort was put into giving you the sensation that you are part of the story. "The Colonel's Bequest" will give back what you put into it. If you don't put much effort into playing it you may feel that there isn't much to the game. But you would be wrong! There is a lot to it--but you may have to dig a bit to find it--and to be very observant. "The Colonel's Bequest" will reward those who are determined; who will notice subtleties; who will ask questions; who will probe. Good luck! We truly hope you enjoy it!"
